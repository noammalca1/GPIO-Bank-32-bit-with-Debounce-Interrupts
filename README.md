GPIO-Bank-32-bit-with-Debounce-InterruptsFull APB based 32 bit GPIO peripheral featuring 2FF input synchronization, programmable debounce, edge/level interrupt controller, and a clean top level integration of pins and APB register file.32-Bit APB GPIO Bank with Debounce & Interrupts (Verilog HDL)Author: Noam MalcaInstitution: Bar-Ilan UniversityFocus: Digital Design - GPIO, APB, Debounce, and InterruptsThis project implements a complete 32-bit GPIO peripheral in Verilog HDL, suitable for integration into APB-based SoC designs.It includes a memory-mapped APB register file, a 2-flop input synchronizer, per-bit digital debounce, a configurable edge/level interrupt controller, and a self-checking SystemVerilog testbench (tb_gpio_32) that verifies GPIO direction, debounce behavior, and interrupt functionality.The design is fully modular and built from the ground up to handle real-world GPIO use cases such as button inputs, status signals, and event-driven interrupts, while protecting against metastability and mechanical switch bounce.Table of ContentsIntroductionSystem OverviewModules DescriptionAPB Register MapData & Control FlowVerification TestbenchDeep Dive: Test 1 AnalysisSimulation and WaveformsLicenseIntroductionThis project demonstrates a robust 32-bit General-Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) peripheral with:APB slave interface for CPU/bus access32 configurable pins (input or output per bit)2-flip-flop synchronization for asynchronous external inputsProgrammable debounce in clock cycles for all input bitsConfigurable edge and level interrupts with per-bit masking and polarityA single bank-level interrupt output (gpio_irq)The system is implemented and verified in Verilog/SystemVerilog using a 100 MHz clock (PCLK) with a VCD waveform dump (dump.vcd) for inspection in tools such as GTKWave.System OverviewThe design is split into four main RTL blocks, connected by a clean top-level module:gpio_32_apb_regs – APB register filegpio_32_pins – pad interface + 2-FF synchronizergpio_32_debounce – per-bit digital debounce enginegpio_32_interrupts – edge/level interrupt controllerTop-level module: gpio_32_top Testbench: tb_gpio_32Modules DescriptionRTL Modules BreakdownGPIO Top-Level – gpio_32_top.vThe integration layer that connects the APB bus interface to the internal logic blocks. It handles the signal routing between the register file and the functional units (debounce, interrupt, pins).Key Feature: Acts as the bridge between the system clock domain (PCLK) and the external asynchronous world.APB Register File – gpio_32_apb_regs.vA memory-mapped register bank compliant with the APB protocol. It manages configuration and status reporting.Register Address Map (Offsets):| Offset | Name | Type | Description || :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- || 0x00 | GPIO_DIR | RW | Direction Control (0=Input, 1=Output). || 0x04 | GPIO_OUT | RW | Output Data Register (Value to drive when DIR=1). || 0x08 | GPIO_IN | RO | Input Data Register (Read-only, debounced value). || 0x0C | INT_MASK | RW | Interrupt Mask (1=Enable, 0=Masked). || 0x10 | INT_STATUS | RW1C | Interrupt Status (Write '1' to Clear). Sticky bit. || 0x14 | INT_TYPE | RW | Interrupt Type (0=Level, 1=Edge). || 0x18 | INT_POL | RW | Polarity (0=Fall/Low, 1=Rise/High). || 0x1C | DEBOUNCE | RW | Debounce Duration (16-bit cycle count). |Pin Interface + 2-FF Synchronizer – gpio_32_pins.vThe physical interface layer.Synchronization: Uses a standard 2-Flip-Flop synchronizer chain to mitigate metastability risks when asynchronous external signals enter the PCLK domain.Tri-State Control: Implements the buffer logic where gpio_dir acts as the Output Enable (OE) for the pads.Debounce Engine – gpio_32_debounce.vFilters out noise and mechanical switch bounce.Algorithm: Maintains a dedicated counter for each of the 32 bits. The counter increments only when the signal is stable. If the signal changes value before the target count (debounce_cfg) is reached, the counter resets. This ensures only "clean" transitions are propagated.Interrupt Controller – gpio_32_interrupts.vA flexible interrupt generation unit.Logic: Combines the synchronized/debounced inputs with the configuration registers (Mask, Type, Polarity).Status Handling: Implements "Sticky" status bits—once an event is detected, the bit remains set until explicitly cleared by software (W1C), ensuring no events are missed by the CPU.Verification Testbench – tb.vA comprehensive SystemVerilog testbench.Tests: Includes directed tests for basic I/O, glitch injection (to prove debounce), rising-edge detection, and level-triggered interrupt clearance sequences.Data & Control FlowThe architecture is designed around a unidirectional data flow for configuration and a bidirectional flow for I/O operations. The system ensures safe clock-domain crossing and noise immunity before signals reach the internal logic.graph TD
